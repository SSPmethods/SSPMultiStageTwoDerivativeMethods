# SSPMultiStageTwoDerivativeMethods
This is a collection of codes which we used to find Optimal SSP multiderivative multistage time stepping methods. 

opt_mdrk:         Optimization Driver file, uses Fmincon to find MDRK methods with largest SSP coeficient\\
Butcher2ShuOsher: Converts a scheme from Butcher representation to an optimal Shu-Osher decomposition \\
mdrk_am_obj	:     Defines the objective function for Fmincon\\
oc_mdrk :         Creates our equality constraints for our optimization routine based off MDRK order conditions\\
nlc_mdrk:         Creates our equality constraints for our optimization routine based off SSP conditions\\
unpackMSMDRK :    Unpacks coeficients from optimization vector into Butcher Matrices\\
packingMSMDRK:    Transfer methods coeficients into optimization vector to feed into Fmincon\\
revealR:          Find largest allowable r for a given method with violating SSP conditions\\
